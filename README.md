🌿 Smart Comfort System – Personalized Study & Workspaces 📚💡

Proud to share our Semester 4 project — a cost-effective smart system designed to enhance focus and comfort in personal workspaces. By automatically adjusting lighting and temperature, the system creates an ideal environment for studying or working without distractions.

⸻

✨ Main Features:

• 🌞 Dynamic Lighting Adjustment: Ambient light sensor detects brightness and modulates LED lights automatically for optimal eye comfort.
• 🌡️ Intelligent Temperature Monitoring via Resistor & Op-Amp Circuit:

Workspace conditions are tracked using a resistor-based sensing circuit.

An op-amp amplifier translates resistance changes into a measurable voltage using Vout = Vin × (1 + R1/R2), enabling real-time detection and control of fan operation.
• 🖥️ Real-Time Automation: NI DAQ and LabVIEW process the analog signals and control actuators seamlessly, providing instant feedback and environment adaptation.
