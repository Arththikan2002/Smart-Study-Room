### 🔊 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)
- Basic ANC system implemented in **LabVIEW using NI DAQ**.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Preamplification:** Strengthens audio signal captured by microphone.
  - **Signal Delay:** Aligns electrical signal with incoming noise wave.
  - **Signal Inversion:** Generates an inverted noise signal to cancel unwanted sound.
  - **Filtering:** Isolates noise for more accurate cancellation.
- Reduces ambient noise, creating a **focused study/work environment**.
