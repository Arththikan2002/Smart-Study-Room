# 🌿 Smart Study Room  
Personalized Comfort & Focus System for Smarter Learning 📚✨  

## 📖 Introduction  
The **Smart Study Room** is our Semester 4 group project, designed to transform ordinary study environments into **intelligent, adaptive spaces**.  

Using **sensors, analog circuits, and NI DAQ with LabVIEW**, the system automatically adjusts lighting and fan operation to improve comfort, reduce distractions, and support long study sessions efficiently.

## 🔧 Core Features  

💡 **Adaptive Lighting**  
- Detects ambient brightness using a light sensor.  
- Adjusts LED intensity automatically for better eye comfort.  

🌡️ **Temperature-Aware Control**  
- Resistor-based sensing circuit monitors heat levels.  
- Op-amp amplifier translates resistance changes into measurable signals.  
- Fan activates automatically when needed for cooling.  

🖥️ **LabVIEW Automation**  
- NI DAQ hardware acquires sensor data in real time.  
- LabVIEW GUI displays system status and allows manual override.
