## ✨ Main Features

### 🌞 Dynamic Lighting Adjustment
- Ambient light sensor detects brightness and automatically modulates LED lighting.
- Ensures **optimal eye comfort** while saving energy.
- Real-time signal processing with **NI DAQ & LabVIEW**.

### 🌡️ Intelligent Temperature Monitoring
- Workspace conditions tracked using a **resistor-based sensing circuit**.
- **Op-Amp amplifier** converts resistance changes into measurable voltage:  
  `Vout = Vin × (1 + R1/R2)`
- Automates fan operation for a **comfortable environment**.

### 🔊 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)
- Basic ANC system implemented in **LabVIEW using NI DAQ**.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Preamplification:** Strengthens audio signal captured by microphone.
  - **Signal Delay:** Aligns electrical signal with incoming noise wave.
  - **Signal Inversion:** Generates an inverted noise signal to cancel unwanted sound.
  - **Filtering:** Isolates noise for more accurate cancellation.
- Reduces ambient noise, creating a **focused study/work environment**.

### 🖥️ Real-Time Automation
- NI DAQ and LabVIEW acquire and process sensor and audio signals.
- Actuators (LEDs, Fan, ANC output) respond instantly to environmental changes.
- Fully **adaptive and user-friendly workspace**.
