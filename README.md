# 🌿 Smart Study Room – Personalized Comfort System 📚💡  

Proud to share our **Semester 4 project** — a **cost-effective smart system** designed to enhance focus and comfort in personal workspaces. By automatically adjusting lighting and temperature, the system creates an ideal environment for studying or working without distractions.  

---

## ✨ Main Features  
- 🌞 **Dynamic Lighting Adjustment**  
  Ambient light sensor detects brightness and modulates LED lights automatically for optimal eye comfort.  

- 🌡️ **Intelligent Temperature Monitoring via Resistor & Op-Amp Circuit**  
  Workspace conditions are tracked using a resistor-based sensing circuit.  
  The op-amp amplifier translates resistance changes into a measurable voltage:  

  \[
  V_{out} = V_{in} \times \left(1 + \frac{R1}{R2}\right)
  \]  

  This enables real-time detection and control of fan operation.  

- 🖥️ **Real-Time Automation with NI DAQ & LabVIEW**  
  Analog signals are processed and actuators controlled seamlessly, providing instant feedback and environment adaptation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Hardware**: Resistor sensing circuit, Op-Amp amplifier, NI DAQ, LED lighting, Fan  
- **Software**: LabVIEW
